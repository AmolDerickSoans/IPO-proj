# IPO-proj
## Using Pipenv
### I recommend using Pycharm for this, even though I am on vscode for now.
### Several reasons, but mostly to do with how the backend works
### We run each task through the command line. For example, python main.py <<task_name>>
### For the above command to run, we need to edit the debug configurations by adding parameters, I do not know how to do that in vscode, hence I recommend going to PyCharm.
### also download redis, installation is pretty simple
